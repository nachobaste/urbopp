## 1. Introduction to Dynamic GEOCUBO {#introduction}

GEOCUBO is designed as a comprehensive urban development analysis platform for Latin America, featuring sophisticated Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) capabilities, interactive mapping, and business model canvas tools. To transform your static GEOCUBO website into a fully dynamic, data-driven application, you need to establish a robust backend infrastructure that can handle real-time data processing, user authentication, and complex analytical computations.

The current GEOCUBO implementation leverages modern web technologies including Next.js 14 with the App Router, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. However, to make it truly dynamic, we need to integrate it with Supabase, a powerful Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides PostgreSQL database capabilities, real-time subscriptions, authentication services, and edge functions.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step required to transform your GEOCUBO installation from a static showcase into a fully functional, production-ready application capable of handling real urban development projects across Latin America. We'll cover database schema design, API integration, authentication setup, real-time features, and deployment strategies that ensure your application can scale to meet the demands of urban planners, real estate developers, and municipal authorities.

The dynamic version of GEOCUBO will enable users to create and manage real projects, perform live MCDA analyses with customizable parameters, collaborate on business model canvases, and visualize project data on interactive maps with real-time updates. By the end of this guide, your GEOCUBO installation will be capable of supporting multiple users, handling complex datasets, and providing the analytical insights necessary for informed urban development decisions.




## 2. Supabase Database Setup {#supabase-setup}

### 2.1 Creating Your Supabase Project

Supabase serves as the backbone of your dynamic GEOCUBO application, providing a PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and edge functions. The setup process begins with creating a new Supabase project that will host all your urban development data, user accounts, and analytical configurations.

To begin, navigate to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new account if you haven't already. Once logged in, click "New Project" and provide the following information:

**Project Configuration:**
- **Project Name**: GEOCUBO Production (or your preferred name)
- **Database Password**: Generate a strong password and store it securely
- **Region**: Select the region closest to your primary user base in Latin America
- **Pricing Plan**: Start with the Free tier for development, upgrade to Pro for production

The project creation process typically takes 2-3 minutes. During this time, Supabase provisions your dedicated PostgreSQL instance, configures the authentication system, and sets up the real-time infrastructure. Once complete, you'll receive your project URL and API keys, which are essential for connecting your GEOCUBO frontend to the backend services.

### 2.2 Database Schema Implementation

The GEOCUBO database schema is designed to support complex urban development analysis workflows while maintaining data integrity and performance. The schema includes tables for projects, MCDA parameters, evaluations, business model canvases, municipalities, and user management.

**Core Tables Structure:**

The `projects` table serves as the central entity, storing comprehensive information about each urban development project. This includes basic project metadata such as name, description, and location, as well as financial data like budget and area calculations. The table also maintains project status tracking and asset classification, enabling sophisticated filtering and analysis capabilities.

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    coordinates JSONB,
    status project_status_enum DEFAULT 'planning',
    asset_class asset_class_enum NOT NULL,
    budget DECIMAL(15,2),
    area_total DECIMAL(10,2),
    units_count INTEGER,
    floors_count INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    updated_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
```

The MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) system requires two interconnected tables: `mcda_parameters` and `mcda_evaluations`. The parameters table defines the criteria used for project evaluation, including category groupings, weight assignments, and value ranges. Each parameter belongs to a specific category such as "Context," "Financial," "Environmental," or "Legal," and carries a weight percentage that determines its influence on the overall project score.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcda_parameters (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    weight DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL CHECK (weight >= 0 AND weight <= 100),
    min_value DECIMAL(3,1) DEFAULT 0,
    max_value DECIMAL(3,1) DEFAULT 10,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The evaluations table stores the actual scores assigned to each project for each MCDA parameter. This design allows for flexible evaluation workflows where projects can be assessed incrementally, with the ability to update scores as new information becomes available or project conditions change.

### 2.3 Advanced Database Features

To support the sophisticated analytical requirements of GEOCUBO, the database implementation includes several advanced PostgreSQL features that enhance performance and functionality.

**PostGIS Integration for Geospatial Data:**

GEOCUBO's mapping capabilities require robust geospatial data handling. PostGIS, PostgreSQL's spatial extension, provides the necessary tools for storing, querying, and analyzing geographic information. This enables features such as proximity analysis, boundary calculations, and spatial clustering of projects.

```sql
-- Enable PostGIS extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;

-- Add geometry column for precise location data
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN geometry GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326);

-- Create spatial index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_geometry ON projects USING GIST (geometry);
```

**Real-time Subscriptions:**

Supabase's real-time capabilities allow GEOCUBO to provide live updates when project data changes, MCDA evaluations are updated, or new projects are created. This is particularly valuable for collaborative environments where multiple users might be working on the same project or when dashboard data needs to reflect the most current information.

```sql
-- Enable real-time for key tables
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE projects;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE mcda_evaluations;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE business_model_canvas;
```

**Row Level Security (RLS):**

Data security is paramount in urban development projects, which often involve sensitive financial and strategic information. Supabase's Row Level Security feature allows you to implement fine-grained access controls that ensure users can only access data they're authorized to see.

```sql
-- Enable RLS on projects table
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for project access
CREATE POLICY "Users can view projects they created or are assigned to" ON projects
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.uid() = created_by OR 
        auth.uid() = updated_by OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM project_collaborators 
            WHERE project_id = projects.id AND user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### 2.4 Database Functions and Triggers

The GEOCUBO database includes several custom functions that automate complex calculations and maintain data consistency. These functions are particularly important for the MCDA engine, which requires real-time score calculations based on weighted parameters.

**MCDA Score Calculation Function:**

This function calculates the overall MCDA score for a project by aggregating weighted parameter evaluations. The calculation considers both parameter weights within categories and category weights within the overall assessment framework.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_mcda_score(project_uuid UUID)
RETURNS DECIMAL(4,2) AS $$
DECLARE
    total_score DECIMAL(10,4) := 0;
    category_record RECORD;
    param_record RECORD;
    category_score DECIMAL(10,4);
    category_weight_sum DECIMAL(5,2);
BEGIN
    -- Get distinct categories with their total weights
    FOR category_record IN 
        SELECT DISTINCT category, SUM(weight) as total_weight
        FROM mcda_parameters 
        WHERE is_active = true
        GROUP BY category
    LOOP
        category_score := 0;
        category_weight_sum := 0;
        
        -- Calculate weighted score for each parameter in category
        FOR param_record IN
            SELECT p.weight, COALESCE(e.value, 0) as eval_value
            FROM mcda_parameters p
            LEFT JOIN mcda_evaluations e ON p.id = e.parameter_id 
                AND e.project_id = project_uuid
            WHERE p.category = category_record.category 
                AND p.is_active = true
        LOOP
            category_score := category_score + (param_record.eval_value * param_record.weight / 100);
            category_weight_sum := category_weight_sum + param_record.weight;
        END LOOP;
        
        -- Add category contribution to total score
        IF category_weight_sum > 0 THEN
            total_score := total_score + (category_score * category_record.total_weight / 100);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
    
    RETURN LEAST(total_score, 10.00);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Automated Timestamp Updates:**

To maintain accurate audit trails, the database includes triggers that automatically update timestamp fields when records are modified. This ensures that all changes to project data, evaluations, and configurations are properly tracked.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_projects_updated_at 
    BEFORE UPDATE ON projects
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```


## 3. Environment Variables and API Configuration {#environment-setup}

### 3.1 Understanding GEOCUBO's Configuration Architecture

The dynamic functionality of GEOCUBO relies heavily on proper environment variable configuration, which serves as the bridge between your frontend application and the Supabase backend infrastructure. Environment variables in Next.js applications follow a specific hierarchy and naming convention that ensures security while providing the flexibility needed for different deployment environments.

GEOCUBO's configuration system is designed to support multiple deployment scenarios, from local development to production hosting, while maintaining security best practices. The application distinguishes between public variables that can be safely exposed to the client-side code and private variables that must remain server-side only. This distinction is crucial for maintaining the security of your database credentials and API keys while ensuring that the frontend can properly communicate with backend services.

The configuration architecture also supports environment-specific settings, allowing you to use different database instances, API endpoints, and feature flags for development, staging, and production environments. This flexibility is essential for maintaining a robust development workflow while ensuring that production data remains secure and isolated from development activities.

### 3.2 Essential Environment Variables Setup

The foundation of your dynamic GEOCUBO installation requires several critical environment variables that establish the connection between your Next.js application and the Supabase backend. These variables must be configured correctly in your hosting environment to ensure proper functionality.

**Core Supabase Configuration:**

The primary connection to your Supabase instance requires two essential variables: the project URL and the anonymous key. The project URL serves as the endpoint for all API communications, while the anonymous key provides the necessary authentication for client-side operations. These values are available in your Supabase project dashboard under the "Settings" > "API" section.

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anonymous-key-here
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is crucial for these variables because they need to be accessible in the browser for client-side operations such as authentication, real-time subscriptions, and direct database queries. Next.js automatically includes variables with this prefix in the client-side bundle, making them available to your React components.

**Service Role Key for Server Operations:**

For server-side operations that require elevated privileges, such as database migrations, administrative functions, or bulk data operations, you'll need the service role key. This key should never be exposed to the client-side and is used exclusively for server-side API routes and administrative scripts.

```bash
# Server-side Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

This key provides full access to your database, bypassing Row Level Security policies, so it must be handled with extreme care. It's typically used in API routes for operations like user management, data imports, and system administration tasks that require unrestricted database access.

**Database Connection Configuration:**

For direct database connections or advanced operations, you may need additional configuration variables that specify connection parameters, SSL settings, and connection pooling options.

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.your-project-id.supabase.co:5432/postgres
DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.your-project-id.supabase.co:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1
```

These URLs enable direct database connections for operations that require more control than the standard Supabase client provides, such as complex migrations, bulk data processing, or integration with external analytics tools.

### 3.3 Application-Specific Configuration

Beyond the basic Supabase connection, GEOCUBO requires additional configuration variables that control application behavior, feature flags, and integration settings.

**MCDA Engine Configuration:**

The Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis engine can be configured through environment variables that control calculation precision, caching behavior, and performance optimization settings.

```bash
# MCDA Configuration
MCDA_CALCULATION_PRECISION=2
MCDA_CACHE_TTL=3600
MCDA_ENABLE_REAL_TIME=true
MCDA_MAX_PARAMETERS=50
```

These settings allow you to fine-tune the MCDA engine's behavior based on your specific requirements. The calculation precision determines how many decimal places are used in score calculations, while the cache TTL (Time To Live) controls how long calculated scores are cached to improve performance.

**Mapping and Geospatial Configuration:**

GEOCUBO's mapping functionality requires configuration for map tile providers, geocoding services, and spatial analysis parameters.

```bash
# Mapping Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_MAP_CENTER_LAT=14.6349
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_MAP_CENTER_LNG=-90.5069
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_MAP_ZOOM=8
GEOCODING_PROVIDER=mapbox
SPATIAL_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true
```

The default map center coordinates are set to Guatemala City, reflecting GEOCUBO's focus on Latin American urban development, but these can be adjusted based on your primary area of operation. The Mapbox access token enables advanced mapping features such as satellite imagery, street-level detail, and custom styling.

**File Upload and Storage Configuration:**

For handling document uploads, project images, and data imports, GEOCUBO integrates with Supabase Storage, which requires specific configuration for bucket management and file processing.

```bash
# Storage Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=geocubo-documents
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=pdf,xlsx,csv,jpg,png,gif
STORAGE_CDN_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public
```

These settings control file upload behavior, including size limits, allowed file types, and CDN configuration for optimal file delivery performance.

### 3.4 Security and Authentication Configuration

GEOCUBO's authentication system requires careful configuration to ensure secure user management while providing a smooth user experience.

**Authentication Provider Configuration:**

Supabase supports multiple authentication providers, and GEOCUBO can be configured to use email/password authentication, social logins, or enterprise SSO solutions.

```bash
# Authentication Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
AUTH_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED=true
AUTH_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT=86400
ENABLE_SOCIAL_AUTH=true
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

The redirect URL is crucial for proper authentication flow, especially in production environments where the domain differs from your development setup. Email confirmation requirements and password policies help maintain security standards appropriate for professional urban development applications.

**Row Level Security Configuration:**

While RLS policies are defined in the database, their behavior can be influenced by application-level configuration that determines how strictly access controls are enforced.

```bash
# Security Configuration
ENABLE_RLS_BYPASS_FOR_ADMINS=false
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com
```

These settings ensure that security policies are consistently enforced while providing the flexibility needed for administrative operations and multi-domain deployments.

### 3.5 Performance and Monitoring Configuration

To ensure optimal performance and enable effective monitoring of your GEOCUBO installation, several configuration variables control caching, logging, and performance optimization features.

**Caching and Performance:**

GEOCUBO implements multiple caching layers to ensure responsive performance, especially for complex MCDA calculations and map rendering operations.

```bash
# Performance Configuration
ENABLE_REDIS_CACHE=true
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-instance:6379
CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL=3600
ENABLE_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION=true
DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=10
API_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60
```

Redis caching significantly improves performance for frequently accessed data such as project lists, MCDA parameter definitions, and calculated scores. The connection pool size should be adjusted based on your expected concurrent user load and hosting environment capabilities.

**Monitoring and Analytics:**

Comprehensive monitoring is essential for maintaining a production GEOCUBO installation, especially when supporting multiple users and complex analytical workflows.

```bash
# Monitoring Configuration
ENABLE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS=true
ANALYTICS_PROVIDER=google
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GA-XXXXXXXXX
ERROR_REPORTING_ENABLED=true
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
```

These configuration options enable detailed monitoring of application performance, user behavior, and error tracking, which are crucial for maintaining a reliable service and understanding how users interact with the urban development analysis tools.

### 3.6 Development vs Production Configuration

GEOCUBO's configuration system supports different settings for development and production environments, ensuring that development activities don't interfere with production data while maintaining consistency in application behavior.

**Development Environment Setup:**

Development environments typically require more verbose logging, disabled caching for immediate feedback, and connections to development databases.

```bash
# Development Configuration (.env.local)
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
DEBUG_MODE=true
ENABLE_HOT_RELOAD=true
DISABLE_CACHE=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-dev-project-id
```

The development configuration enables features like hot reloading, detailed debugging information, and direct database access that facilitate rapid development and testing cycles.

**Production Environment Setup:**

Production environments prioritize performance, security, and stability, with configuration optimized for handling real user traffic and sensitive urban development data.

```bash
# Production Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG_MODE=false

### 4.2 Vercel Deployment Process

The deployment of GEOCUBO to Vercel involves several steps that ensure optimal performance and proper configuration of all dynamic features.

**Repository Preparation and GitHub Integration**

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure your GEOCUBO repository is properly configured in GitHub with all necessary files, environment variables templates, and deployment configurations. The repository should include a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes sensitive information while including all necessary build artifacts and configuration files.

Create a `vercel.json` configuration file in your repository root that specifies build settings, environment variable requirements, and routing rules specific to GEOCUBO's architecture:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "@supabase_url",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@supabase_anon_key",
    "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "@supabase_service_key"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that Vercel properly handles GEOCUBO's API routes, manages environment variables securely, and optimizes the build process for production deployment.

**Environment Variable Configuration in Vercel**

Vercel's environment variable management system provides secure storage and deployment-specific configuration for your GEOCUBO installation. Access the Vercel dashboard for your project and navigate to the "Settings" > "Environment Variables" section to configure the necessary variables.

Environment variables in Vercel can be scoped to specific environments (Development, Preview, Production), allowing you to maintain separate configurations for testing and production deployments. This is particularly important for GEOCUBO, where you may want to use different Supabase projects or configuration settings for development and production environments.

When configuring environment variables in Vercel, ensure that sensitive values like the Supabase service role key are marked as sensitive, which prevents them from being displayed in logs or accessible through the Vercel CLI. The platform automatically encrypts these values and injects them securely into your application during runtime.

**Build Optimization and Performance Configuration**

GEOCUBO's complex analytical capabilities and mapping features require specific build optimizations to ensure optimal performance in production. Vercel's build system can be configured to optimize bundle sizes, enable advanced caching strategies, and implement performance monitoring.

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  images: {
    domains: ['your-project-id.supabase.co'],
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
  },
  compress: true,
  poweredByHeader: false,
  generateEtags: false,
  httpAgentOptions: {
    keepAlive: true,
  },
  onDemandEntries: {
    maxInactiveAge: 25 * 1000,
    pagesBufferLength: 2,
  },
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      config.optimization.splitChunks.chunks = 'all';
      config.optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups = {
        default: false,
        vendors: false,
        vendor: {
          name: 'vendor',
          chunks: 'all',
          test: /node_modules/,
        },
        common: {
          name: 'common',
          minChunks: 2,
          chunks: 'all',
          enforce: true,
        },
      };
    }
    return config;
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

This configuration enables advanced bundle splitting, image optimization, and compression features that significantly improve GEOCUBO's loading performance and user experience.

### 4.3 Database Migration and Data Setup

Once your GEOCUBO application is deployed, the next critical step involves setting up the database schema and populating it with initial data necessary for the application to function properly.

**Automated Database Migration Process**

GEOCUBO includes automated migration scripts that can be executed from your deployed application to set up the complete database schema. These scripts handle the creation of tables, indexes, functions, and security policies required for full functionality.

The migration process should be executed in a specific order to ensure proper dependency resolution and data integrity. Create a deployment script that can be run from your Vercel deployment or locally against your production database:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# GEOCUBO Production Deployment Script

echo "Starting GEOCUBO database setup..."

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Set up initial MCDA parameters
npm run db:seed:mcda

# Create sample municipalities for Latin America
npm run db:seed:municipalities

# Set up default user roles and permissions
npm run db:seed:auth

echo "Database setup completed successfully!"
```

This script ensures that all necessary database components are properly configured and that the application has the baseline data required for immediate use.

**Initial Data Population for Latin American Context**

GEOCUBO's effectiveness depends on having relevant baseline data for Latin American urban development contexts. The initial data setup should include MCDA parameters appropriate for the region, municipality information for major urban centers, and sample projects that demonstrate the platform's capabilities.

The MCDA parameter setup should reflect the unique challenges and opportunities present in Latin American urban development, including factors such as infrastructure availability, regulatory environments, market conditions, and environmental considerations specific to the region.

Sample municipalities should cover major urban centers across Latin America, including capitals and significant secondary cities, with accurate geographic coordinates and demographic information that enables meaningful analysis and comparison of urban development opportunities.

### 4.4 Custom Domain Configuration and SSL

Professional deployment of GEOCUBO requires custom domain configuration that reflects your organization's branding and provides a trustworthy user experience for urban development professionals.

**Domain Setup and DNS Configuration**

Configure your custom domain through your DNS provider to point to Vercel's servers. This typically involves creating CNAME records that direct traffic from your domain to Vercel's edge network. The specific DNS configuration depends on whether you're using a subdomain (like geocubo.yourcompany.com) or a root domain (yourcompany.com).

For subdomain configuration, create a CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`. For root domain configuration, you'll need to use A records pointing to Vercel's IP addresses, though CNAME configuration is generally preferred for better performance and reliability.

Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains through Let's Encrypt, ensuring that all communication between users and your GEOCUBO application is encrypted. This is particularly important for applications handling sensitive urban development data and financial information.

**Performance Optimization with CDN**

Vercel's global edge network automatically optimizes content delivery for your GEOCUBO application, but additional configuration can further improve performance for users across Latin America. Configure edge caching rules that optimize the delivery of static assets, API responses, and dynamic content based on user location and content type.

The platform's automatic image optimization significantly improves loading times for project images, maps, and other visual content that are central to GEOCUBO's user experience. Configure image domains in your Next.js configuration to enable optimization for images served from Supabase Storage or other external sources.

### 4.5 Monitoring and Analytics Setup

Production deployment of GEOCUBO requires comprehensive monitoring to ensure reliable operation and to understand how users interact with the urban development analysis tools.

**Application Performance Monitoring**

Implement application performance monitoring that tracks key metrics such as page load times, API response times, database query performance, and user interaction patterns. Vercel provides built-in analytics that offer insights into performance metrics, but additional monitoring tools may be necessary for comprehensive coverage.

Configure error tracking and reporting systems that alert you to issues before they impact users. This is particularly important for GEOCUBO, where calculation errors or data inconsistencies could affect critical urban development decisions.

## 5. Troubleshooting and Maintenance {#troubleshooting}

### 5.1 Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

The complexity of GEOCUBO's architecture, with its integration of Next.js, Supabase, mapping services, and analytical engines, can lead to various deployment and operational challenges. Understanding these common issues and their solutions is essential for maintaining a reliable urban development analysis platform.

**Database Connection Issues**

One of the most frequent problems encountered during GEOCUBO deployment involves database connectivity issues between the Next.js application and Supabase. These issues often manifest as timeout errors, connection pool exhaustion, or authentication failures that prevent the application from accessing project data or performing MCDA calculations.

Database connection problems typically stem from incorrect environment variable configuration, network connectivity issues, or Supabase project configuration problems. The first step in diagnosing these issues involves verifying that all environment variables are correctly set and accessible to the application. Use the Vercel dashboard or your hosting platform's environment variable management system to confirm that the Supabase URL, anonymous key, and service role key are properly configured and match the values from your Supabase project dashboard.

Connection pool exhaustion can occur when the application creates too many simultaneous database connections, particularly during periods of high user activity or when performing bulk MCDA calculations. Supabase implements connection pooling automatically, but applications must be designed to properly manage and release database connections. Implement connection monitoring and ensure that database queries are properly optimized to minimize connection duration.

Network connectivity issues between your hosting platform and Supabase can cause intermittent connection failures. These problems are often related to geographic distance between servers, network routing issues, or temporary service disruptions. Implement retry logic in your database connection code and configure appropriate timeout values that balance responsiveness with reliability.

**Authentication and Authorization Problems**

GEOCUBO's authentication system relies on Supabase Auth, which can encounter various configuration and operational issues that prevent users from accessing the application or specific features. Authentication problems often manifest as login failures, session expiration issues, or incorrect permission handling that prevents users from accessing their projects or performing administrative functions.

Session management issues frequently occur when the application's authentication configuration doesn't properly handle token refresh, session persistence, or cross-domain authentication scenarios. Ensure that your authentication configuration includes proper session timeout settings, token refresh mechanisms, and secure cookie handling that works across your domain configuration.

Row Level Security (RLS) policy conflicts can prevent users from accessing data they should be able to see or allow access to data that should be restricted. These issues require careful review of your RLS policies to ensure they correctly implement your intended access control logic. Use Supabase's policy testing tools to verify that policies work correctly for different user roles and scenarios.

Social authentication integration problems can occur when OAuth providers change their configuration requirements or when redirect URLs are incorrectly configured for your production domain. Verify that all OAuth provider configurations include the correct redirect URLs for your production environment and that client IDs and secrets are properly configured in both Supabase and the provider's developer console.

**MCDA Calculation and Performance Issues**

The Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis engine is one of GEOCUBO's most computationally intensive features, and performance problems can significantly impact user experience and application reliability. MCDA calculation issues often manifest as slow response times, timeout errors, or incorrect calculation results that affect project evaluation accuracy.

Calculation performance problems typically result from inefficient database queries, lack of proper indexing, or suboptimal algorithm implementation. The MCDA engine performs complex weighted calculations across multiple parameters and categories, which can become computationally expensive as the number of projects and parameters increases. Implement database query optimization, including proper indexing on frequently queried columns and query result caching for commonly requested calculations.

Parameter weight validation errors can cause calculation failures when the sum of category weights or parameter weights within categories doesn't equal 100%. Implement comprehensive validation logic that ensures weight consistency before performing calculations and provides clear error messages when validation fails. The validation should occur both at the user interface level and in the database layer to prevent invalid data from being stored.

Real-time calculation updates can cause performance issues when multiple users are simultaneously updating MCDA parameters or project evaluations. Implement debouncing mechanisms that prevent excessive calculation requests and consider using background job processing for complex calculations that don't require immediate results.
