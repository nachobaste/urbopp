Okay, here's a narrative explanation of the database relationships, aimed at a non-expert audience, broken down into manageable chunks. I'll avoid technical jargon as much as possible and use analogies where helpful.
1. The Big Picture: Organizing Geographic Information
Imagine you're trying to organize information about every place in the world, from entire continents down to tiny villages. This database is designed to do just that, and to connect that location information to all sorts of other data. Think of it like a giant, highly organized filing cabinet.
    • Continents: We start with the biggest boxes: Continents (like North America, Europe, Asia). Each continent has a name and a simple code (like "NA" for North America).
    • Countries: Inside each continent box, we have smaller boxes for Countries (like USA, Canada, Mexico). Each country has a name, a code (like "USA"), and we know which continent it belongs to. We also store the capital city.
    • States/Provinces: Countries are often divided into States (or provinces, regions, etc., depending on the country). So, inside the "USA" box, we have smaller boxes for California, Texas, New York, and so on. Each state has a name and a code, and we know which country it belongs to.
    • Municipalities: States are further divided into Municipalities (think of these as cities or towns). Inside the "California" box, we have boxes for Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, etc. Each municipality has a name and a code, and we know which state it belongs to.
    • Coordinates: Each Municipality has a table called Coordinates Where you can see the geographical position (latitude and longitude) of the municipality.
    • Country Groupings: Sometimes, we want to group countries together for reasons other than just being on the same continent (e.g., trade blocs, economic regions, cultural groups). That's what CountryGroupings is for. Think of it like creating special labels. We might have a label called "Central American Countries," and we'd stick that label on the boxes for Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, etc. The CountryGroupingAssociations table is how we "stick" those labels – it connects countries to their groupings.
Key Idea: Hierarchy The whole structure is hierarchical: Continent -> Country -> State -> Municipality. This lets us easily find all the municipalities in a state, all the states in a country, and so on. It's like nesting dolls, but for geographic data.
2. People in those Places: Demographics
Now, let's talk about the people who live in these places. We want to know a lot about them, but in an organized way. We focus on the municipality level – that's where we collect most of our detailed demographic data.
    • MunicipalPopulationByGender: How many males and females live in each municipality? This table tells us the total population, broken down by Gender (Male, Female, etc. – the Gender table defines the possible options). We also know when this data was collected (DATAGATHEREDDATE).
    • MunicipalPopulationByAgeGroups: How many people are in different age ranges (like 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, etc.) in each municipality? The AgeGroups table defines these ranges, and this table links those ranges to population counts.
    • MunicipalPopulationByMaritalStatus: How many people are single, married, divorced, etc., in each municipality? The MaritalStatus table defines the possible statuses.
    • MunicipalPopulationByEconomicallyActiveStatus: How many people are employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force in each municipality? EconomicallyActiveStatus defines these categories.
    • MunicipalPopulationByResidentialStatus: How many people live in urban areas vs. rural areas within each municipality? ResidentialStatus defines "urban" and "rural."
    • MunicipalPopulationByEducationalLevel: How many people have completed different levels of education (e.g., primary school, high school, university) in each municipality? EducationalLevel defines these levels.
    • MunicipalPopulationByHouseholdRole: How many people are heads of households, spouses, children, etc., within each municipality? HouseholdRole defines these roles.
Key Idea: Breakdowns We're taking the total population of each municipality and slicing it up in different ways – by gender, age, marital status, and so on. This lets us see the composition of the population.
3. Services and Technology: What's Available?
We also want to know about the services and technology available to people in each municipality.
    • ElectricityCoverageByMunicipality: What percentage of households in each municipality have access to electricity?
    • WaterCoverageByMunicipality: This is a bit more complex. There are different types of water access (piped water, wells, rainwater collection, etc. – defined in WaterCoverageTypes). This table tells us how many households in each municipality have access to each type of water coverage.
    • CellPhoneUsageByMunicipality: We have different types of usage of cell phones registered on CellphoneUsage table, that are linked to this table.
    • ComputerUsageByMunicipalities: We have different types of usage of computers registered on ComputerUsage table, that are linked to this table.
    • InternetUsageByMunicipality: Again, there are different types of internet usage (defined in InternetUsageType). This table tells us how many people in each municipality use the internet in each way.
Key Idea: Access These tables are about access to essential services and technology. They help us understand the infrastructure and resources available in different areas.
4. How "Competitive" is a Place?
    • CompetitivenessIndexByMunicipality: This is a more abstract concept. We have different criteria for measuring competitiveness (defined in CompetitivenessIndexCriterion – things like infrastructure, education, innovation, etc.). This table gives each municipality a score for each criterion. It's like a report card for how well a municipality is doing in different areas.
5. The Cost of Living: Fuel Prices
    • FuelPriceByMunicipality: How much does different types of fuel (gasoline, diesel, etc. – defined in FuelPriceType) cost in each municipality? This helps us understand the cost of transportation and energy.
6. The Big Picture: Macroeconomics (Country Level)
Now we zoom out to the country level and look at the overall economy.
    • MacroeconomicIndicators: This is a general table for any kind of country-level economic indicator (like inflation, unemployment, GDP, etc.). Each indicator has a short name (like "CPI" for Consumer Price Index) and a full name. It's linked to a specific Country.
    • Sources: Where did we get this economic data? The Sources table stores information about the organizations or publications that provide the data.
    • GrossDomesticProduct (GDP): This is a specific type of macroeconomic indicator – the total value of goods and services produced in a country. We have different types of GDP measurements (defined in GrossDomesticProductType), and this table stores the actual GDP value for each type, for a specific date. It also links back to the Sources table.
    • Population & Urban Population: Tables for population and urban population, as well as its types.
    • Interest Rates: Information about interest rates for a country.
    • Foreign Direct Investment: Information about foreign investment.
    • Industry Value Added: What percentage of a country's GDP comes from different industries?
    • Exports: How much does the country sell to other countries.
    • International Homicides
    • Literacy
    • Employment: Data on employment, broken down by type (formal, informal, etc. – defined in EmploymentType).
    • NationalInflation: The overall inflation rate for a country. We also have a breakdown of inflation by category of spending (food, housing, transportation, etc. – defined in NationalInflationCategories).
    • ConsumerPriceIndex (CPI): A measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.1
    • ExchangeRates: How much is the country's currency worth compared to the US dollar? The Currencies table defines the different currencies, and CountryCurrencies tells us which currencies are used in which countries.
Key Idea: Economic Health These tables give us a picture of the overall economic health and performance of each country.
7. Industry-Level Data
Now we get even more specific, looking at individual industries within each country.
    • CIIU... Tables These tables uses the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), a United Nations system for classifying economic data, and it's hierarchical:
        ◦ CIIUSection: The broadest categories (e.g., "A" for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing).
        ◦ CIIUDivision: More specific categories within a section (e.g., "01" for Crop and Animal Production).
        ◦ CIIUGroup: Even more specific (e.g., "011" for Growing of Non-Perennial Crops).
        ◦ CIIUClass: The most detailed level (e.g., "0111" for Growing of Cereals).
    • IndustryRelatedMacroeconomicIndicators: These are economic indicators that are specific to a particular industry within a country. For example, we might track the "production volume" of the "textile industry" in "Guatemala."
    • IndustryImportsData: This table tracks the imports of goods related to specific industries. It connects the CIIUClass (the industry), the ORIGINCOUNTRYID (where the goods came from), the IndustryRelatedMacroeconomicIndicators (what's being measured, e.g., "import value"), and the DATAGATHEREDDATE.
    • UnitOfMeasure: Table for the measurement unit.
    • TariffCodes: These are codes used in international trade to classify products. This table links tariff codes to both the CIIUClass (the industry) and products (a grouping of related tariff codes).
    • Products: Table for products.
    • SalariesByMunicipalityIndusGend The Average salaries broken down by genre, industry and ocupation.
    • Ocupation: Table with the ocupations available.
Key Idea: Specificity This section lets us drill down into the performance of specific sectors of the economy.
In Summary
This database is designed to store and connect information about:
    1. Geography: From continents down to municipalities.
    2. Demographics: Characteristics of the population within those municipalities.
    3. Services and Technology: Access to essential services.
    4. Competitiveness: How municipalities compare on various factors.
    5. Cost of Living: Focusing on fuel prices.
    6. Macroeconomics: Country-level economic indicators.
    7. Industry: Detailed data on specific industries within countries.
The relationships between the tables allow us to ask complex questions, like:
    • "What is the average salary for women in the textile industry in a specific municipality?"
    • "How does the literacy rate in a country correlate with its GDP?"
    • "What is the trend in electricity coverage in rural areas of a particular state?"
    • "What is the import value of goods related to the 'Growing of Cereals' industry from Mexico to Guatemala"
By organizing the data in this way, we can analyze trends, make comparisons, and gain insights into the social and economic conditions of different places around the world.
