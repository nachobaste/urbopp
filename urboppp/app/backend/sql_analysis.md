# SQL Data Structure Analysis

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the provided SQL files (`UrbopServices_GTData.sql` and `3D. DATA HUB (FINAL).sql`), I've identified the key data structures that need to be supported in the backend data upload system and integrated with Google Earth Engine for geographical visualization.

## Geographic Data Structure
The database contains a hierarchical geographic structure:
- Continents
- Countries (with groupings)
- States/Provinces
- Municipalities
- Coordinates (latitude/longitude)

This geographic data will be essential for Google Earth Engine integration, as it provides the spatial foundation for displaying shapefiles and other geographical data.

## Demographic Data
The database contains detailed demographic information at the municipal level:
- Population by gender
- Population by age groups
- Population by marital status
- Population by economic activity
- Population by residential status (urban/rural)
- Population by educational level
- Population by household role

## Business and Project Data
The database includes structures for:
- Clients
- Consultants
- Projects (linked to geographic locations)
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Business Model Canvas elements
- Parameters and categories

## Key Tables for Google Earth Engine Integration
For GEE integration, these tables are most relevant:
- Coordinates (lat/long data)
- Municipalities (for region identification)
- States and Countries (for higher-level aggregation)
- Projects (to link business data with geographic locations)

## Data Upload Requirements
The backend system needs to support:
1. Uploading and validating geographic data
2. Uploading demographic data with proper relationships
3. Uploading project and business model data
4. Maintaining data integrity across related tables
5. Supporting GIS data formats for Google Earth Engine

## Next Steps
1. Develop a backend data upload system with proper validation
2. Research Google Earth Engine API integration
3. Implement GIS visualization components
4. Update the website with these new features
